The (release version of the) package will automatically be pushed to GitHub private NuGet source on build.
For this to work, the GitHub API key should be stated in a global environmental variable called
	GITHUB_NUGET_KEY

e.g. 
	GITHUB_NUGET_KEY=ghp_ABCDEFghijklm123456

The API key must have permissions to create and install packages. It is not specific to a repo.
